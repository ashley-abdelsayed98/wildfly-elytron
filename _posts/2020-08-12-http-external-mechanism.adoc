synopsis: Overview of Elytron support for the HTTP External Mechanism

WildFly Elytron now supports authenticating users with the External HTTP mechanism. This means if you have users authenticated
by an Apache httpd server, these users can be forwarded to WildFly via the AJP protocol. This can be done by setting up
Elytron to secure a WildFly deployment and specifying for the External HTTP mechanism to be used. This is done by specifying
the `EXTERNAL` mechanism as one of the mechanism configurations to be used by the `http-authentication-factory`:
[source, shell]
----
/subsystem=elytron/http-authentication-factory=web-tests:add(security-domain=example-domain, http-server-mechanism-factory=example-factory,
mechanism-configurations=[{mechanism-name=EXTERNAL}])
----
If your application is secured using this `http-authentication-factory` and a remote server forwards an authenticated
user using the `REMOTE_USER` attribute via the AJP protocol, Elytron will accept the externally authenticated user and
use the specified security domain to perform role mapping to complete authorization.
