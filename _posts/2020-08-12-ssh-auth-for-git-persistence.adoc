When using a standalone WildFly server, it is currently possible to manage your configuration file history using a git
repository. While previously it was only possible to connect to HTTP git servers, it is now possible to establish a connection
with SSH servers as well.

In order to connect to the SSH git repository, you will have to use an Elytron configuration file to set up SSH credentials.
This blog will describe how to generate SSH keys and add them as credentials in a `wildfly-config.xml` file and how to
start the standalone server with an SSH git repository to manage your configuration file history.

== Generating SSH keys using the Elytron Tool
Elytron offers a way to generate and store private keys securely in a credential store. We can use the Elytron tool scripts
found in your JBOSS home to do so. For this example, we will be creating a new credential store and generating an RSA key.

First, we must create the credential store:

[source,shell]
----
[$JBOSS_HOME]$ ./bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --create --location=cs_example.cs --password Elytron
----
This command creates a credential store in the file `cs_example.cs` and secures the credential store with the password
`Elytron`. Note the file `cs_example.cs` does not need to exist before running this command to create the credential store.

Next, we generate a key pair to store in the credential store:
[source,shell]
----
[$JBOSS_HOME]$ ./bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location=cs_example.cs --password Elytron --generate-key-pair example --algorithm RSA --size 3072
----
This command generates an RSA key pair credential of size 3072 bytes and stores it under the alias `example` in the credential
store we created.

Finally, we can print our public key with the following command:
[source,shell]
----
[JBOSS_HOME]$ ./bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location=cs_example.cs --password Elytron --export-key-pair-public-key example
ssh-rsa

If you already have an SSH key pair, it is possible to import the key into a credential store. See the

for more information

=== The `wildfly-config.xml` configuration

Once we have our key pair credential in a credential store, we can reference it from our `wildfly-config.xml` file as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <authentication-client xmlns="urn:elytron:client:1.6">

     <credential-stores>
        <credential-store name="store1">
           <protection-parameter-credentials>
              <clear-password password="Elytron"/>
           </protection-parameter-credentials>
           <attributes>
              <attribute name="keyStoreType" value="JCEKS"/>
                <attribute name="location" value="cs_example.cs"/>
           </attributes>
        </credential-store>
     </credential-stores>

     <authentication-rules>
        <rule use-configuration="example-config"/>
     </authentication-rules>

     <authentication-configurations>
        <configuration name="example-config">
           <credentials>
              <credential-store-reference store="store1" alias="example" clear-text="Elytron"/>
           </credentials>
        </configuration>
     </authentication-configurations>

  </authentication-client>
</configuration>
----

This configuration defines a new credential store from the file we created. It then references the alias `example` (which
stores the RSA key pair we generated) to be used as credentials.

== Generating SSH keys using the OpenSSH command line tool
Alternatively, one may use the OpenSSH command line tool to generate their SSH keys. The algorithms supported by Elytron
are: RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. For example, we can generate an ECDSA key of size 256 and encrypted with the passphrase “secret”
as follows:
[source,shell]
----
[~/.ssh]$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256
Generating public/private ecdsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): secret
Enter same passphrase again: secret
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub.
----
For more information on how to generate OpenSSH keys see: https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen[OpenSSH Documentation]

=== The `wildfly-config.xml` configuration
If you already have SSH keys generated, you can add them as credentials a couple of ways:

==== Key Pair Credential
One way is to specify your keys directly in the `wildfly-config.xml` using a `key-pair` credential as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <authentication-client xmlns="urn:elytron:client:1.6">

     <authentication-rules>
        <rule use-configuration="example"/>
     </authentication-rules>

     <authentication-configurations>
        <configuration name="example">
           <credentials>
              <key-pair>
                 <openssh-private-key pem="-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----">
                    <clear-password password="secret"/>
                 </openssh-private-key>
              </key-pair>
           </credentials>
        </configuration>
     </authentication-configurations>
  </authentication-client>
</configuration>
----
This configuration shows how to specify keys which are in OpenSSH format. In this example, we specify the passphrase `secret`
that is required to decrypt the key as a `clear-password` type, but we could have also used a `masked-password` or a
`credential-store-reference`.

Elytron also supports keys in PKCS8 format, but they must not be encrypted with a passphrase.

==== SSH credential
The other way to add existing keys as credentials is to specify the location and file name containing your private keys
using a `ssh-credential` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <authentication-client xmlns="urn:elytron:client:1.6">

     <authentication-rules>
        <rule use-configuration="example"/>
     </authentication-rules>

     <authentication-configurations>
        <configuration name="example">
           <credentials>
              <ssh-credential ssh-directory="/user/home/example/.ssh" private-key-file="id_test_ecdsa" known-hosts-file="known_hosts_test">
                 <clear-password password="secret"/>
              </ssh-credential>
           </credentials>
        </configuration>
     </authentication-configurations>
  </authentication-client>
</configuration>
----
* The `ssh-directory` attribute specifies the location of the key and the known hosts file.
* The `private-key-file` attribute specifies the name of the file containing your private key.
* The `known-hosts-file` attribute specifies the name of the file containing the known SSH hosts.

This key was encrypted with the passphrase `secret` and so we specify a `clear-password` to be able to decrypt it, but
again we could have also used a `masked-password` or a `credential-store-reference`.

It is also possible to specify both a `key-pair` credential and `ssh-credential` at the same time if you would
like to specify your private key using a `key-pair` but your `known_hosts` file is not in the default `[user.home]/.ssh` location and you need
to use the `ssh-credential` to specify its location.

For more information on the `key-pair` credential and `ssh-credential` check out the
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_client-guide/authentication-client.adoc[Elytron Authentication Client Documentation]

== Connecting to a git repo

Once we have added our credentials in a `wildfly-config.xml` file, we can connect to the remote SSH git repo.
To connect, we use the SSH url of this repo and specify the following options when starting the standalone WildFly server:
[source,xml]
----
[JBOSS_HOME]$ ./bin/standalone.sh --git-repo=ssh:giturl.com/repo --git-auth=file:///path/to/wildfly-config.xml
----
* The `--git-repo` option specifies the uri of the git repo we would like to connect to.
* The `--git-auth` option specifies the location of the `wildfly-config` file containing your credentials.

And all done! We should be able to successfully start up our standalone server and your configuration file history will be
managed by the repository we connected to. For more information on git persistence, check out:
